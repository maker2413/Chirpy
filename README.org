#+TITLE: Chirpy

This program was created while following along with the course on [[https://www.boot.dev/u/maker2413][Boot.dev]].

To properly run Chirpy you will need a postgres database. I personally recommend
just using a docker image, in which case you can run the following:
#+begin_src shell
  make startpostgres
#+end_src

You will also need to create the chirpy database:
#+begin_src shell
  make createdb
#+end_src

I also use [[https://github.com/pressly/goose][goose]] to apply the sql files to the postgres database, which you can
apply with the following:
#+begin_src shell
  make gooseup
#+end_src

To run Chirpy you will need to do the following:
#+begin_src shell
  go run .
#+end_src

To build the Chirpy executable you can do the following:
#+begin_src shell
  make build
#+end_src
